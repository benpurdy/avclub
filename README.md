Remote control for the XOXO outpost projector/audio gear.

This is a very quick and dirty one-off web app to control a Marantz 6007 Receiver and a Christie DHD951-Q projector via a simple web UI instead of two horrendously overcomplicated remote controls.

Feel free to adapt this code to your own uses, I make no gaurantee that it's any good.

Should be easily adaptable to most Marantz SRx000x and AVxx0x receivers, and many of the Christie DHD, DWU, and DWX projectors since they share a lot interms of the command protocols.
